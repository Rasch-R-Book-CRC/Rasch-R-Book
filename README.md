Companion to BER 670: Rasch Techniques for Constructing and Evaluating Measurement Instruments

This book is still in progress !!! This is a draft. Several sections are still incomplete or unedited.

This book is written to help students enrolled in the University of Alabama, Rasch Measurement Theory (BER 670) course led by Professor Stefanie Wind.

We hope that the book will be a useful resource to help you learn both R and statistics. If you have any suggestions for improvements, please get in touch with your lovely TA: Cheng Hua, at chua@crimson.ua.edu
